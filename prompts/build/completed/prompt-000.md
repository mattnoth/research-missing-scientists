# Prompt 000 — Bootstrap

You are Claude Code operating in the directory `/Users/mnoth/source/research-missing-scientists/`. Your task is to initialize this directory as a research repository for an investigation into a cluster of deaths and disappearances of U.S. scientists and researchers tied to defense, aerospace, nuclear, and advanced-research programs. This prompt does no research. Its job is plumbing only.

## Non-interactive execution (read first)

This prompt, and every prompt in this series, runs via `claude -p --output-format=stream-json` — print mode. There is no stdin. You cannot pause to ask the user questions; any question you emit will be recorded in the stream but will not block execution, and the process will exit without the user's answer. Therefore:

- **Do not ask the user questions in this prompt.** Make decisions autonomously based on the spec. If a genuinely ambiguous situation arises that the spec does not cover, use your best judgment, document the decision in `logs/research-log.md` (create it if needed), and proceed.
- **The only exception** is if continuing would clearly violate a hard safety rule (sudo escalation, out-of-scope writes, unapproved installs, contact attempts) — in that case, stop and emit a clear error to the output stream before exiting non-zero. The `&&` chain in `run-all.sh` will then halt.
- **Idempotency:** if prior state exists (git repo initialized, files present), integrate with it; do not wipe it.

## Hard Safety Rules (apply to every prompt in this series)

- **Working directory is `/Users/mnoth/source/research-missing-scientists/`. Do not read, write, move, or touch anything outside this directory.** The one exception is `/Users/mnoth/source/mattnoth-dev/`, which is only touched by prompt-003 and only after that prompt's own checks.
- **Do not install anything system-wide.** No `sudo`. If a tool is needed and not already present, ask the user before installing via `brew` or `npm`. Reputable packages only (widely used, well-maintained, verifiable on official registries). When in doubt, ask.
- **Do not push to any git remote. Do not authenticate to any service.** Commit locally only. The user pushes.
- **Do not attempt to contact anyone** — no emails, no web forms, no social media posts, no "request for comment." Research uses only already-public material.
- **Do not run anything with network effects beyond the provided search/fetch tools and `git` local operations and package managers (when approved).** No `curl` to arbitrary endpoints, no scripted web scraping outside the provided tools.
- **If you are unsure whether an action is in scope, stop and ask.**

## Downstream prompt alteration

If, in the course of completing this prompt, you identify issues with any of the subsequent prompts (`prompt-001.md` through `prompt-004.md`) that would prevent them from executing correctly — missing context, incorrect assumptions about state this prompt produces, conflicts with decisions you've made here — you may alter them. Document every alteration in `logs/prompt-alterations.md` (create the file if it does not exist) with: prompt filename, what was changed, why, and the date. Do not alter prompts for stylistic preference; only for correctness.

## Your Tasks for This Prompt

### 1. Verify the directory
- Confirm `/Users/mnoth/source/research-missing-scientists/` exists.
- Confirm `prompt-001.md` (and presumably `prompt-000.md` through `prompt-004.md`, plus `run-all.sh` and `RUNBOOK.md`) are present at the root. If not, stop and tell the user.
- Check whether the directory is already a git repo.
  - **If not:** proceed with `git init` below.
  - **If yes:** operate idempotently. Skip `git init`. Audit the existing skeleton against the spec. Fill any missing files or directories. If the existing README lacks the full methodology section specified below, add it. Commit any changes with message `chore: repair bootstrap skeleton`. Do not wipe or reset. Do not ask the user — this prompt always runs non-interactively via `-p` mode and cannot accept input. Proceed autonomously to completion.

### 2. Initialize git
- Run `git init` in the working directory.
- Set an initial branch name of `main`.
- Create a `.gitignore` covering: macOS junk (`.DS_Store`), editor files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`), Node/npm artifacts if any ever appear (`node_modules/`, `npm-debug.log`), Python venv if any ever appear (`.venv/`, `__pycache__/`), and output directories we'll generate later (`pdf-output/` is the anticipated one — confirm below).

### 3. Create the directory skeleton
Use your judgment on exact names, but the skeleton should support the research that follows. A reasonable starting layout:

```
research-missing-scientists/
├── README.md                    # methodology, source tiers, how to read everything
├── CHANGELOG.md                 # living-artifact change log
├── RUNBOOK.md                   # how to run the prompt chain (already present)
├── run-all.sh                   # chained CLI command (already present)
├── prompt-000.md ... prompt-004.md
├── dossier.md                   # the top-level synthesized document (written by 001)
├── cases/                       # one markdown file per case (written by 001)
├── appendices/
│   ├── primary-sources/         # verbatim excerpts from Tier 1 docs
│   ├── named-expert-commentary/ # on-the-record statements from identifiable experts
│   └── foreign-coverage/        # translated excerpts with provenance
├── analysis/
│   ├── connection-analysis.md   # tight / medium / corkboard layers
│   ├── hypotheses.md            # pre-registered hypotheses + evaluations
│   └── foreign-intel-layer.md   # dedicated analysis layer
├── data/
│   ├── diagram-data.json        # structured spec for the connection diagram
│   ├── timeline-data.json       # structured spec for the timeline
│   └── schema/                  # JSON schemas defining both formats
├── logs/
│   ├── research-log.md          # chronological log of what was searched and found
│   ├── contradictions.md        # conflicts between sources, tracked
│   └── known-unknowns.md        # gaps where primary sources couldn't be located
└── pdf-output/                  # written by 002, gitignored
```

You may adjust this if you see a cleaner structure. The **spirit** is: primary research in `cases/` and `appendices/`, analysis in `analysis/`, structured data for rendering in `data/`, honest record-keeping in `logs/`.

### 4. Write a minimal README skeleton
Not the full README — just enough to be a valid starting point. Prompt 001 will expand it. Include:
- One-sentence project description
- A placeholder "Methodology" section with the source-tier taxonomy (see below — copy it verbatim)
- A placeholder "How to read this repository" section
- A note that PDFs are generated separately (prompt 002) and the website rendering is separate (prompt 003)

### 5. Write the Methodology section verbatim from the following

```markdown
## Methodology

### Source tiers
Every source cited in this repository is categorized by tier. Tiers are not a
fixed list of three — finer distinctions are used where the evidence warrants.

- **Tier 1 — Primary sources.** Law enforcement press releases and case
  bulletins (LAPD, BCSO, NMSP, LA County Sheriff, Taos County); court filings
  and charging documents; White House press-briefing transcripts on .gov or
  equivalent archival sources; official statements from DOE/NNSA/FBI/Air Force
  on .gov domains; Congressional records; institutional statements and
  obituaries published directly by the employer (Caltech, MIT PSFC, NASA JPL,
  LANL, KCNSC, AFRL); direct statements from family members (Facebook posts
  from verified family accounts, family-run search pages, on-camera press
  conferences) — primary for the family's own statements, not for facts about
  the investigation itself.

- **Tier 2 — Secondary reporting.** Mainstream news (CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC,
  Reuters, AP, Washington Post, NYT); local news (Albuquerque Journal, Taos
  News, Los Alamos Reporter, KRQE, KOB, CBS LA, Boston Globe); specialty
  trade press. Network "Dateline" and "what we know" roundups are Tier 2,
  not primary, even when they quote primary sources.

- **Tier 3 — Tertiary / aggregator.** Wikipedia; news roundups citing other
  news outlets without original reporting; "here's what we know so far"
  compilations.

- **Tier 4 — Named expert commentary.** On-the-record statements from
  identifiable subject-matter experts (e.g., former FBI officials, CSIS /
  NTI / think tank analysts, UAP-disclosure advocates with documented
  professional backgrounds). Evaluated individually on the expert's
  credentials and the relevance of their claim.

- **Tier 5 — Secondary reporting relying on anonymous sources.** Claims that
  appear in Tier 2 outlets but trace to a single anonymous source and are
  then repeated across other outlets. The Daily Mail's KCNSC employment
  claim for Steven Garcia is the canonical example.

- **Tier 6 — Independent commentary, Substack, YouTube, TikTok, podcasts,
  social media.** Useful for finding leads and seeing what claims are in
  circulation. Not used as evidence for factual claims.

- **Tier 7 — Foreign state-affiliated press.** Included when geopolitically
  relevant. Country of origin and known editorial orientation noted. Not
  dismissed for being foreign; not elevated for being foreign.

### Confidence ratings
Separate from source tier, every factual claim in this repository carries
one of the following labels:

- **Confirmed** — Multiple independent primary sources, or a single primary
  source making a self-evidencing statement (e.g., a sheriff's press
  release stating the sheriff issued an alert).
- **Reported** — Appears in credible secondary reporting, often with named
  sources, but not directly confirmable via primary documentation.
- **Alleged** — Claim made by a specific identifiable source but not
  independently confirmed.
- **Speculated** — Inference, theory, or pattern-matching not directly
  asserted by any source.

The **tier** tells you provenance. The **rating** tells you weight. These
are independent. A Tier 1 source can make a "may have been a danger to
himself" statement that rates only "Reported." A Tier 2 article can cite
a rock-solid court filing that rates "Confirmed."

### Inclusion criteria for cases
Cases are included based on this repository's own criteria, not based on
any external list (including the White House review list):

- Employment in or documented association with U.S. defense, aerospace,
  nuclear, or advanced-research programs
- Death or disappearance between 2022 and the present
- At least one of: unexplained circumstances; unresolved investigation;
  primary-source law-enforcement or institutional involvement

Cases that fit the pattern are included regardless of whether they appear
on any public list. Cases on public lists that do not fit the pattern are
still included, with a clear "inclusion rationale" explaining the weaker
fit (e.g., Amy Eskridge, Jason Thomas).

### Neutrality and bias handling
- No country or political entity is pre-excluded or pre-implicated.
  Hypotheses involving any state actor (including allies such as Israel
  and the United Kingdom, adversaries such as Russia, China, and Iran,
  and the United States itself) are evaluated on evidence alone.
- Sensational framing ("assassinations," "silenced," "targeted") is
  avoided in this repository's own prose. Such framing from sources is
  quoted and attributed, not adopted.
- White House, FBI, and other U.S. government statements are Tier 1 as
  documents (they are primary evidence of what was officially said) but
  the factual claims inside them are evaluated on the same standard as
  any other source.
- Exotic hypotheses (foreign intelligence targeting, UAP/UFO-related
  theories, other speculative frameworks) are evaluated as hypotheses:
  what evidence would support them, what evidence contradicts them, and
  what is the base rate. Not dismissed a priori; not endorsed without
  evidence.

### No contact policy
No attempts are made to contact any individual, family member, agency,
employer, or journalist in connection with this research. All sourcing
uses already-public material only.
```
