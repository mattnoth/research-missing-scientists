# Research Log

Chronological record of searches performed, sources consulted, and decisions made. Also serves as the append-only session ledger per [.claude/commands/end-session.md](../.claude/commands/end-session.md).

## 2026-04-21 — Agent harness install (tailored)

**What happened:**
- Committed [INSTALL-PROMPT.md](../INSTALL-PROMPT.md) and [AGENT-HARNESS.md](../AGENT-HARNESS.md) — generic, portable agent-harness tooling.
- Installed a **tailored** harness variant in this repo instead of running the generic install. Rationale: this repo's knowledge already has a domain-native taxonomy (`cases/`, `analysis/`, `appendices/`, `logs/`); the generic layer model (`knowledge/`, `workflows/`, `extractions/`) would force renames without adding value.
- Created [NAVIGATION.md](../NAVIGATION.md) — intent-keyed routing table covering dossier, research content, methodology, open threads, agent operation.
- Created [.claude/commands/end-session.md](../.claude/commands/end-session.md) — session-close ritual with 8 steps: research-content capture, integrity artifacts (contradictions, known-unknowns, dossier sync), tier consistency, navigation, actionables reconciliation, mandatory research-log append, status/changelog, final report.
- Edited [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — added a "Session structure" section pointing at NAVIGATION.md, `/end-session`, and AGENT-HARNESS.md.
- Existing artifacts preserved and integrated: `logs/research-log.md` is the session ledger (this entry is the first dogfood), `TODO-research.md` is the actionables file.

**Key decisions:**
- No `progress.md` created — `logs/research-log.md` already plays that role.
- No `knowledge/`, `workflows/`, `extractions/` directories created — current structure is sufficient.
- Rotation threshold intentionally deferred: research-log is structured by prompt-run, not per-session entries. Split to `logs/research-log-prompt-NNN.md` when a run section grows unwieldy.
- INSTALL-PROMPT.md is kept in-repo (untracked → tracked) for future reuse, not because we ran the generic install here.

## 2026-04-20 — Bootstrap (prompt 000)

- Initialized repository structure.
- No research performed in this prompt; plumbing only.

## 2026-04-20 — Prompt 001 research begins

### Orchestration approach
- **Lead orchestrator** reads the full prompt, spawns sub-agents, enforces source discipline, merges outputs.
- **Case-research agents** — one per case, 11 total, run in parallel. Each writes `cases/{slug}.md` and populates `appendices/primary-sources/{slug}/`.
- **Primary-source hunter** — separate agent, runs in parallel with case agents, focuses exclusively on Tier 1 documents.
- **Foreign-coverage agent** — searches foreign press, runs in parallel.
- **Named-expert-commentary agent** — locates on-the-record expert statements, runs in parallel.
- **Cross-case analysis agent** — runs after case files are complete.
- **Diagram-and-timeline agent** — runs after analysis is complete.
- Orchestrator writes dossier abstract and executive summary **last**.

### Cases included (initial list from prompt)
1. Anthony "Tony" Chavez — LANL, missing May 2025
2. Melissa Casias — LANL, missing June 2025
3. Monica Jacinto Reza — NASA JPL, missing June 2025

- **No LANL institutional statement found.** Only the broader NNSA acknowledgment applies.
- **No Silver Alert found** despite Chavez being 78 years old.
- **Specific LANL role unknown.** No source identifies job title, division, or clearance status. This is a significant gap for inclusion assessment.
- **Case number:** #2025-0254 (from Los Alamos Reporter)
- **DOB confirmed:** January 7, 1947 (NM DPS)

#### Contradictions identified
- Height/weight discrepancy between NM DPS (5'7", 145 lbs) and LAPD notice (5'6", 135 lbs)
- Race listed as "Unknown/Other" in NM DPS vs. "White male" in LAPD notice
- Last seen date: NM DPS says 05/08 (report date), local media says May 4 (actual last sighting)
- NM DPS case entry date of 01/13/2023 is anomalous

#### Gaps remaining

### Casias case research

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Researcher:** Sub-agent (Claude)

#### Searches performed
1. WebSearch: "Melissa Casias LANL missing 2025" -- 10 results, strong coverage
2. WebSearch: "Melissa Casias Taos County missing" -- 10 results, overlapping with #1
3. WebSearch: "Melissa Casias Los Alamos missing person" -- 10 results, additional national outlets
4. WebSearch: "Melissa Casias phones factory reset wiped LANL" -- 10 results, confirmed family-sourced claim
5. WebSearch: "New Mexico State Police Melissa Casias press release missing endangered" -- found NamUs listing MP150628
6. WebSearch: "site:nmsp.dps.nm.gov OR site:namus.nij.ojp.gov Melissa Casias" -- confirmed NamUs entry
7. WebSearch: "Melissa Casias niece Jazmin McMillen phones wiped" -- traced phone-reset claim to McMillen

#### Pages fetched
1. ABQ Journal (Aug 26, 2025) -- most detailed single source; full timeline, phone detail, blue truck lead
2. Santa Fe New Mexican (early July 2025) -- strong early reporting; phone detail, family quotes
3. Taos News (July 9, July 23, Sept 3, 2025) -- local coverage, paywalled/JS-rendered (partial extraction only)
4. CBS News (2026) -- national aggregation; McMillen quote on clearance level
5. KOB (nuclear ties article) -- partial extraction only
6. NBC Dateline -- 403 error
7. NamUs MP150628 -- JS-rendered, confirmed via metadata only
8. KRQE -- 403 error
9. KOB (family one month) -- JS-rendered, minimal extraction

#### Key findings
- **Factory-reset phone claim is FAMILY-SOURCED (niece Jazmin McMillen), NOT confirmed by NMSP publicly.** Tier 3 provenance (via local media), not Tier 1.
- McMillen told CBS: "Melissa was an administrative assistant and did not have high-level clearance" -- pushes back on high-clearance framing.
- McMillen also told CBS she has not "seen any evidence linking her to any of the other cases."
- NMSP spokesperson Wilson Silver confirmed "no updates" in August 2025; notably restrained public posture.
- No standalone NMSP press release was found online.
- No LANL or DOE statement was found.
- Taos News reported "family divided" on July 9 -- details not fully accessible.
- Mark Casias (husband) repeatedly noted as "unavailable for comment."
- NamUs case MP150628 confirmed.

#### Contradictions identified
- Clearance level: task brief says "security clearance"; niece says "did not have high-level clearance" (not necessarily contradictory -- admin staff typically hold Q clearance for facility access)
- "Forgot badge" narrative vs. husband's account of her going to another LANL location
- Family division reported but not elaborated

#### Gaps remaining
- No Tier 1 confirmation of phone factory reset
- Taos News articles largely inaccessible (JS-rendered or paywalled)
- No LANL or DOE public statement located
- No information on investigation progress after September 2025
- Family division details unclear
- Foreign coverage not searched
- Surveillance footage details (alone? distressed? others visible?)
- Backpack contents unknown
- Post office errand purpose unknown

10. Caltech student newspaper (The California Tech) -- colleague quotes (T3), successful
11. KTLA -- 403 error
12. LA Mag -- 403 error

#### Key findings
- **Named suspect Freddy Snyder, 29, charged with murder, carjacking, and burglary.** Strong criminal case.
- **Pattern of escalating criminal behavior by Snyder:** trespassing with loaded rifle (Dec 20) -> attempted jail escape (Dec 21) -> released on OR (Dec 23) -> neighbor burglary (Dec 28) -> weapons charges dismissed (Feb 5) -> fatal shooting (Feb 16) -> carjacked own mother (Feb 16).
- **System failure:** Felony weapons charges dismissed less than two weeks before the murder, reportedly due to lack of prior record.
- **No known motive disclosed.** Detectives say they found no prior connection between the men beyond the December trespassing.
- **Grillmair's work was entirely unclassified civilian research:** exoplanets, stellar streams, near-Earth object surveying. No known security clearances.
- **Caltech memorial (T1) provided comprehensive career details.** 147 publications, NASA medal, nearly 30 years at IPAC.
- **LA County Board of Supervisors honored Grillmair on March 3, 2026 (T1).**
- **No direct LASD press release found on lasd.org.** All LE-sourced facts come through media relay.

#### Contradictions identified
- Date of death: Feb 16 (consensus/most sources) vs. Feb 17 or Feb 21 in some outlets
- Bail amount: $2M (CBS) vs. $3.175M (Fox 11, MyNewsLA, Pasadena Now)
- 911 caller identity not disclosed

#### Gaps remaining
- No motive publicly disclosed
- No direct LASD press release located (only media relays of LE information)
- Arraignment outcome unknown (scheduled for April 29, 2026)
- Snyder's mental health status and whether evaluation ordered
- Identity of 911 caller
- Whether firearm used in shooting forensically matches the rifle from December
- No court filings directly accessed (no public docket link found)
- LA Times deep investigation was accessible only through Yahoo syndication

#### Assessment
This case has the strongest non-conspiracy explanation of any in the cluster. A local man with an escalating pattern of criminal behavior, who had previously trespassed on Grillmair's property while armed, returned and killed him. The primary systemic question is why the justice system failed to hold Snyder after the December arrest. This case supports hypothesis H8 (independent events misgrouped) most strongly. It does not support H4, H5, or H7.

12. House Oversight press release (T1) -- returned 403

#### Key findings
- **Patent claims CONFIRMED.** Three US patent applications (2003, 2004, 2010) for "Burn-resistant and high tensile strength metal alloys" list Monica A. Jacinto and Dallis Ann Hardwick as co-inventors. Alloy known commercially as Mondaloy. Used in AR1 engine components. Patent assigned to individuals, not corporate entity.
- **JPL title partially verified.** LASD listing on Solve the Case states "Director of the Materials Processing Group at NASA JPL" (T1). No JPL directory or NASA statement independently confirms. Wikipedia repeats title with reliability caveats.
- **Prior career at Aerojet Rocketdyne confirmed** (37+ years, Technical Fellow rank). Also worked at Boeing (2004, Associate Technical Fellow).
- **LASD is lead agency.** Case NIC: M668487735. Classified as "at-risk missing person." Assigned to Homicide Bureau Missing Persons Unit.
- **Find a Grave anomaly documented.** Memorial created June 26, 2025, listing death date June 22, 2025, with "green burial" -- while search was still active. Memorial removed ~March 27, 2026, after media reporting.
- **Cell phone forensic data was obtained but not publicly released** (per since-removed Montrose SAR Facebook post).
- **911 call same morning** from Mt. Waterman area reported woman screaming. Not publicly connected to or excluded from case.
- **No NASA/JPL institutional statement found** specifically about Reza.
- **No family public statements found** beyond privacy request conveyed through LASD.
- **Federal investigation confirmed** via House Oversight Committee (Comer/Burlison) and White House.

#### Contradictions identified
1. Find a Grave memorial with death date and "green burial" created while search active; no death certificate or remains located
2. Cell phone data obtained but never released; SAR post about it removed
3. Minor title discrepancies across sources (Director of Materials Processing vs. Director of Materials Processing Group vs. Fellow at Rocketdyne -- likely sequential roles)

#### Gaps remaining
- No JPL organizational confirmation of title
- No NASA/JPL public statement about Reza
- Hiking companions not publicly identified
- Cell phone forensic results unknown
- Find a Grave creator "lillian" not identified
- Security clearance level unspecified
- No family public statements beyond privacy request
- Connection to McCasland (also missing) alleged but unconfirmed
- Dallis Hardwick (co-inventor, d. 2015) death circumstances not examined
- House Oversight press release content not accessible (403)

8. CBS News (T4) -- successful; skeptical perspectives from CSIS, NTI, former DOE official
9. Global Times (T8) -- successful; Chinese state media framing with conspiracy amplification

#### Key findings
- **Cause of death not disclosed in any source.** Not in obituary, not in professional memorials, not in media reporting.
- **No autopsy record found** per Newsweek reporting; not confirmed by LA County Medical Examiner on record.
- **Left JPL in 2022, died 2023.** One-year gap unexplained. Possible retirement, layoff (JPL had budget cuts), health, or other reasons.
- **Obituary requests donations to al-anon.org** -- Al-Anon is a support organization for families of people with alcohol use disorders. This may provide biographical context.
- **No NASA/JPL institutional statement found** regarding his death.
- **Colleague Dr. Joe Masiero on record** with mentoring characterization.
- **CBS News review found no links between any of the deaths** in the broader pattern.

#### Contradictions identified
- Employment end (2022) vs. death (2023) gap unexplained
- "No autopsy record found" may reflect incomplete records search rather than confirmed no autopsy
- Pattern claims by Congress/media vs. skepticism from security analysts

#### Gaps remaining
- Cause of death
- Whether autopsy was conducted (no on-record statement from LACME)
- Reason for leaving JPL in 2022

6. CBS News (T4) -- successful; skeptical perspectives (same as Hicks research)
7. The Hill (T4) -- 403 Forbidden
8. Global Times (T8) -- successful (shared fetch with Hicks); Maiwald listed among 11 cases

#### Key findings
- **Cause of death not disclosed in any source.** Obituary simply states he "passed away."
- **No autopsy reportedly performed** per multiple media outlets; original basis for claim unclear (possibly records search).
- **NASA never commented publicly on Maiwald's death.** Only public record is Legacy.com obituary.
- **Active researcher at time of death:** Co-authored SPIE paper published May 2024, died July 4, 2024.
- **JPL Principal designation** -- an honor for "outstanding individual contributions," distinct from PI role.
- **June 2023 astrobiology breakthrough claim** -- media report he led research relevant to detecting life on icy moons ~13 months before death. Specific publication not identified.
- **German-born** -- immigration/citizenship status and clearance eligibility implications unreported.
- **3,400+ citations** across career; research spanned THz technology, microwave radiometry, and imaging spectrometry.
- **CBS News review found no links** between any of the deaths.

#### Contradictions identified
- "Principal researcher" vs. "principal investigator" conflated in media; JPL "Principal" is a specific honor
- "No autopsy performed" -- source of claim unclear; not confirmed on-record by LACME
- Employment start date approximate (~1999 from media; obituary does not specify)
- Pattern claims vs. security analyst skepticism

#### Gaps remaining
- Cause of death
- Whether autopsy was conducted (no on-record LACME statement)
- Security clearance level
- Specific June 2023 astrobiology publication
- NASA/JPL internal communications about his death
- Immigration/citizenship status
- Federal agency response to Comer/Burlison inquiry

#### Key findings: KCNSC employment sourcing chain
**The entire KCNSC employment claim traces to a single anonymous source speaking to DailyMail.com (~April 12, 2026).** No outlet has published independent confirmation:
- **Daily Mail:** Original outlet; anonymous source described Garcia as property custodian at KCNSC with top clearance
- **Newsweek:** Explicitly stated it "has not independently verified his employment details"; reached out to KCNSC (no response documented)
- **CBS News:** Used "reportedly" without attribution
- **Fox News Digital:** Appears to have repeated the claim; LiveNOW from FOX cited Fox News as source
- **NewsNation:** Reporter Lauren Conlin discussed Garcia on air, appears to relay the anonymous source's characterizations
- **British Brief:** Explicitly cited "anonymous source revealed to the Daily Mail"
- **Daily Wire:** Cited Economic Times India
- **KCNSC/Honeywell FM&T:** No public statement confirming or denying
- **NNSA:** General statement acknowledging awareness of reports; did not name Garcia

#### Contradictions identified
1. APD "danger to himself" warning vs. anonymous source's "very stable person" characterization
2. Employment claim from anonymous source vs. complete absence of official confirmation

#### Gaps remaining
- Was Garcia actually employed at KCNSC? No official confirmation exists
- APD basis for "danger to himself" warning
- Identity and credibility of the anonymous source
- No APD press release or Silver Alert located
- No family statements found
- No FBI/federal review status specific to Garcia
- Investigation updates since August 2025
- No NamUs entry found

### McCasland case research

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Researcher:** Sub-agent (Claude)

#### Searches performed
19 web searches conducted covering: disappearance details, military career (AFRL, SAPOC, NRO, GPS, Office of Special Projects), post-retirement career (ATA/BlueHalo, Riverside Research), DeLonge/UAP connection (WikiLeaks emails, wife's statements, congressional interest), search efforts (BCSO, FBI), 911 call details, and political affiliations.

#### Pages fetched (successful)
10 pages successfully fetched: Wikipedia biography (T5), Newsweek (3 articles, T4), ABC News (T4), Fox News (T4), CBS News (T4), WikiLeaks emailid/3099 (T1), ABQ Journal (T3), Newsweek "Who is McCasland" (T4). 8 pages returned 403 or failed rendering, including the BCSO press release PDF (T1) and House Oversight press release (T1).

#### Key findings
- Military career comprehensively documented: 34-year USAF career spanning classified satellite reconnaissance, GPS, AFRL command, NRO, SAPOC executive secretary.
- Disappeared Feb 27, 2026 between 11:10 AM and 12:04 PM. Left phone/glasses/wearables. Took boots/wallet/.38 revolver/backpack.
- Wife's 911 call: "I have some indication that he must have planned not to be found." Also relayed statement about not wanting to live with deteriorating brain/body.
- Mental fog confirmed but not dementia per wife and BCSO.
- DeLonge/UAP: WikiLeaks email documents DeLonge's claims; wife confirms brief unpaid consulting for fiction; denies Roswell knowledge. McCasland silent.
- BCSO: no evidence of foul play, no classified-work connection, no link to other cases.
- Still missing as of April 20, 2026. No sightings. USAF sweatshirt found 1.25 mi east, unconfirmed as his.

#### Assessment
Highest-profile case in cluster. Current evidence more consistent with voluntary departure driven by medical/psychological distress than foul play. Supports H1/H8, H2, tangentially H6 (weaker than publicly perceived). Does not currently support H4 or H7.

- `data/schema/diagram-schema.json`, `data/schema/timeline-schema.json`

### Uncommitted modified files (rate-limit artifacts)
- `data/diagram-data.json` — 831 lines, fully populated with 11 person nodes, 10 institution nodes, 6 location nodes, 6 program nodes, 44 edges, 3 layer definitions. Valid JSON.
- `data/timeline-data.json` — 436 lines, fully populated with 29 case events, 14 context events. Valid JSON.
- `logs/contradictions.md` — 101 lines, expanded from 20-line skeleton; 12 within-case + 4 cross-case contradictions documented.
- `logs/known-unknowns.md` — 156 lines, expanded from 45-line skeleton; 16 case-specific + 7 cross-case analytical gaps.
- `run-all.log` — 58 new lines of pipeline transcript (not a research artifact).

### Untracked files
- `prompt-reconcile.md` — reconciliation prompt (operational, not a pipeline artifact)
- `prompt-resume.md` — resume prompt (operational, not a pipeline artifact)
- `reconcile.log` — reconciliation log (operational)

### Missing artifacts
- `STATUS.md` — required by prompt-001 spec as a final deliverable. Never created.

### Directory health
- `pdf-output/` — empty (expected; prompt-002 produces PDFs)
- No empty directories under `appendices/primary-sources/` — all 11 cases have files
- `.gitignore` does not cover `run-all.log` or `reconcile.log`

### Assessment
All four uncommitted modified files are complete, well-formed, and consistent with the spec. None are truncated. The rate limit hit after these files were written but before they could be committed. They should be committed as-is.

## Reconcile summary (2026-04-21)

### Uncommitted files at start and how each was handled
- `data/diagram-data.json` — Complete, 831 lines. Committed as-is (7c891e4).

### Files needing migration

**`cases/grillmair.md`** — ~40 old T2 tags. All sources are local LA media (ABC7, Fox 11 LA, CBS LA, MyNewsLA, Pasadena Now, LA Times/Yahoo, Caltech student paper). All T2 → T3.

**`cases/mccasland.md`** — ~35 old T2 tags. Mix of national outlets (CNN, ABC News, Fox News, Newsweek, NewsNation → T4), local (ABQ Journal → T3), and aggregator (Wikipedia → T5).

**`cases/loureiro.md`** — ~20 old T2 tags. Mix of local (CBS Boston, WBUR, Boston 25 → T3), national (NBC News, PBS, ABC News → T4), and aggregator (Wikipedia, NextBigFuture → T5). Also: Max Planck condolence statement reclassified T2 → T1 (institutional primary source); CNN Portugal → T3 (geographic proximity to Portuguese story).

**`logs/research-log.md`** — ~60 old tags across all tiers:
- Old T7 (Global Times, 2 occurrences) → T8
- Old T6 (Sentinel Briefing, 2 occurrences) → T7
- Old T3 (Wikipedia, aggregators, ~6 occurrences) → T5
- Old T2 (~50 occurrences) → T3 or T4 per outlet

**`logs/contradictions.md`** — 10 remaining old T2 tags (lines 75, 85, 90, 95, 104, 105, 109, 110, 114, 119). All are national outlets (Newsweek, Fox News, CBS News, NewsNation) → T4.

**`logs/audit-checklist.md`** — 2 old-system references in example/description text.

### Ambiguities logged

1. **Max Planck Institute condolence statement (loureiro.md line 159):** Tagged old T2 (media) but is actually an institutional statement → reclassified as T1. Not a media outlet.
2. **CNN Portugal (loureiro.md line 158):** Portuguese outlet covering a case involving two Portuguese nationals. Geographic/cultural proximity to the story → classified as T3 (beat reporting), not T4.
3. **NextBigFuture (loureiro.md line 92):** Tech blog/aggregator, not original reporting → classified as T5 (aggregator), not T4.
4. **British Brief (research-log.md line 413):** Small UK news/commentary site → classified as T5 (aggregator/tertiary), not T4. Lacks the reporting capacity of listed T4 international outlets.
5. **Colorado Springs Gazette (research-log.md line 418):** Covers military beat broadly but has no geographic proximity to the Garcia case (Albuquerque) → classified as T4.
6. **Daily Wire (research-log.md line 415):** Cited Economic Times India, not independent reporting → classified as T5 (aggregator/tertiary).

## 2026-04-21 — Tier migration complete (prompt-retag-tiers)

### Summary

Migration from 7-tier to 8-tier source classification system complete.

**Tags updated by new tier:**
| New Tier | Count (approx.) | Migration path |

- `TODO-research.md` (marked migration tasks complete)
- 8 case files already migrated in prior pass (casias, chavez, eskridge, garcia, hicks, maiwald, reza, thomas)

**Files NOT modified (per exclusion list):**
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `prompts/research/README.md`, `prompts/build/prompt-retag-tiers.md`

**Prompt specification files left unchanged:**
- `prompts/build/prompt-000.md`, `prompts/build/prompt-001.md`, `prompts/research/prompt-deep-*.md` — These define the OLD tier system as originally written. Updating them would rewrite historical specifications. They describe the system under which prompt-001 research was conducted.

**Quality checks passed:**
- No file in `cases/`, `analysis/`, `appendices/`, or `logs/` contains old-system `(T2)` tags
- `(T2)` grep returns only the excluded migration prompt file
- No news outlet is tagged T2 — T2 is reserved for named expert commentary
- Total tier references approximately equal before and after (tags remapped, not added or removed)
